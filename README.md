# Firefly Web Studio mock website

Pretty self-explanatory. It's simply practice with the official logos kindly provided by Firefly...


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Prerequisites

No software installation required.

```
Though owning a functioning PC is quite advantageous. Apart from that, and an internet connection, you're good.
